# My First Repository as a Full-Stack Engineer
This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer. In this project, I will be using Git to manage version control and GitHub to host my code repository.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a simple repository with a single file, `README.md`. The purpose of this file is to provide an introduction to the project, explain its purpose, and provide basic instructions on how to use it.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Git installed on your local machine . Once you have Git installed, you can clone the repository by running the command

~~~~
git clone <remote URL>
~~~~
Replace `<remote URL>` with the URL of the remote repo on GitHub.

#### Usage
This project is a basic template for creating a new repository on GitHub. It includes a simple `README.md` file that can be customised to suit the need of your project.

To use this template, follow the following steps:
* Clone the repo to your local machine using Git.
* Customize the `README.md` file to provide an introduction to your project.
* Add any other files or directories you need for your project.
* Commit your changes using Git and push them to the remote repository on GitHub.
##### Contributing
This is a personal project and contributions are not expected. However, if you do have suggestions or improvements to make, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.
